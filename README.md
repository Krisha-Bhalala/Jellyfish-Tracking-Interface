# Jellyfish-Tracking-Interface

## Description

This project implements a simple virtual drag-and-drop interaction using an image of a jellyfish. The image can be moved on a canvas with a draggable rectangle (representing a "net"). If the rectangle overlaps the jellyfish image, a message is displayed, indicating whether the jellyfish is "in the net" or "out of the net."

This project utilizes Python, Google Colab, OpenCV, and JavaScript to display and interact with the canvas.

## Features

- Upload and display an image on a canvas.
- Drag a rectangle over the image to check for overlap.
- Display a message based on whether the rectangle overlaps the image (jellyfish in/out of net).
- Canvas interactivity with mouse events (drag, move).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- JavaScript (HTML5 Canvas)

## How to Use

1. **Upload an image**: When running the script in Google Colab, upload an image file.
2. **Interact with the canvas**: Drag the rectangle over the image. The message will update based on whether the rectangle overlaps the image.

## Installation

No installation required. This project runs directly in Google Colab.

## How to Run

1. Upload the script to a Google Colab environment.
2. Run the script.
3. Upload the image to interact with the canvas.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more interactive elements.
- Provide customization options for the rectangle and image.
- Improve UI for better user experience.
